# Semester-Project2

A auction house - created with the NorOff Api

This is a Semester project for NorOff School of technology
In this application I will use the information given from the NorOff Auction API to display and manage listings from users.

It's build on Bootstrap and Sass, and displayed on Netlify: https://regal-kheer-f50aa3.netlify.app

For installing node and bootstrap run

```
npm i

npm run build
```

The app is also provided with CDN links for the deployment on Netlify to go smooth. (this is so the bootstrap JS files works on Netlify).
